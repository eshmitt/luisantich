Throughout this project I tried to follow a minimalistic design that used overlays as navigation and previews of images. During production there were various elements that could not be solved with the time allowed. Due to leaving a lot of the content till the last minute, certain elements could not become responsive, overlay elements were not achieved as wanted.

Validation forms were applied but not to satisfaction. The test plan "execute client-side performance testing" was a plan put into place to test how the website performs on other browsers. The website did not meet the expected outcomes with only Google Chrome being available for viewing as the CSS is removed when used on other platforms.

Adding visual testing was the secon test plan, with the main task being for the website to be responsive, (screenshots can be found in TESTING folder in ZIP)

Performing navigation across all platforms, due to the navigation overlay javascript not being able to open it on click the only navigation available is the "more" option at the bottom of the homepage.

Finally, validating forms, origanally the goal was to use vee-validate and I did attempt to complete the form using the process, as evident of the form.vue file, but the validation was done inline to atleast get the basic need across.
